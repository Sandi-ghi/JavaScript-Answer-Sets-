1. Check if a Number is Positive, Negative, or Zero
  
   Write a JavaScript program that:
   Prompts the user to enter a number.
   Uses an if...else statement to determine if the number is positive, negative, or zero.
   Displays an appropriate message for each case.

2. Determine if a Year is a Leap Year
   Write a program that:
   Takes a year (as a number) as input.
   Uses conditional statements to check whether the year is a leap year. (A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, unless it is divisible by 400.)
   Prints out whether the year is a leap year or not.
   Hint: Use the logical operators && (AND) and || (OR).

3. Identify the Day of the Week Using a Switch Statement
   Create a program that:
   Takes a number between 0 and 6 as input, where 0 corresponds to Sunday, 1 to Monday, and so on.
   Uses a switch statement to print the corresponding day of the week.
   Handles any number outside the range with a default message.


4. Even or Odd Checker with Ternary Operator
   Write a program that:
   Declares a variable with a numeric value.
   Uses a ternary operator to check if the number is even or odd.
   Assigns the result to another variable and prints the message.

5. Simple Calculator Using Conditional Statements
     
   Write a function calculate(num1, num2, operator) that:
   Takes two numbers (num1 and num2) and a string operator ("+", "-", "*", or "/").
   Uses if...else if...else statements to perform the appropriate arithmetic operation based on the operator.
   Returns the result of the calculation.
   If an invalid operator is provided, return an error message.
1. Answer
<script>
  let num = prompt("enter the number");
  if (num > 0 ){
    console.log("number is positive")
  } else if (num < 0 ){
    console.log( "the number is negative");
  }else {
    console.log("the number is zero")
  }
</script>

2. Answer
<script>
 let year = prompt ("enter the year")
  if (year % 4 === 0 && year % 100 != 0 || (year % 400 === 0) ){
    console.log(`${year} year is leap year`)
    }  else if (year < 0 ){
alert ( `${year} year is not valid`)
    }else  {
      console.log( `${year} year  is not leap year`)
    }
</script>

3. Alreaddy solved in lession 

4. Answer
<script>
 let num = prompt ("enter the number")
   let result = (num % 2 === 0) ? " even" : "odd";
    console.log(`the number is ${result} .`)
</script>

5. Answer 
<script>
function Calculate (num1, num2, Operator) {
   if (Operator === "+") {
   return num1 + num2 ;
   }else if (Operator ===  "-"){
    return num1 - num2 ;
   }else if  (Operator === "*"){
    return num1 * num2 ;
   }else if  (Operator === "/" ){
    return num1 / num2 ;
   }else if (Operator != "+" || "-" || "*"|| "/"){
    alert (`The "${Operator}"  Operator is not valid`)
   }else {
    console.log ("calculation eror")
   }
}
console.log (Calculate (8,2, "+" ))
console.log (Calculate (8,2, "-" ))
console.log (Calculate (8,2, "*" ))
console.log (Calculate (8,2, "/" ))
console.log (Calculate (8,2, "=" ))
